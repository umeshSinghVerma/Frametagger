# 🎥 FrameTagger - Revolutionize Video Tagging Experience

## Introduction: The Story Behind FrameTagger

During exam season, I found myself watching countless YouTube videos to study. I needed a way to quickly capture important slides and moments, so I began by manually taking screenshots, pasting them into a Word document, writing notes over them, and then printing the document as a PDF for quick revision. This method worked, but it was slow, tedious, and repetitive.

I thought, **why not create something that could handle this entire process for me?** And that’s how **FrameTagger** was born—an efficient tool to capture, annotate, and organize YouTube video snapshots, all in one seamless experience.
